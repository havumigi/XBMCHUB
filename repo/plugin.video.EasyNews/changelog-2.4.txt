Added more custom addon settings
min filesize: Self explanatory
max filesize: Self explanatory
exclude languages: (Just enter i.e german french italian) remember though lots of mkvs has multiple audio so if there is an mkv with german in the 
title but has english audio aswell it will not return that mkv see how you get on
exclude resolution: ( just enter i.e 1080 ignore p's or i's)this is my personal favourite
newsgroups: (if you are a hardcore easynews man you will know what this does you can just define what newsgroup
you search from you can add all favourites online so you dont get any porn or languages you dont like i.e if
you only want results form alt.binaries.movies just enter movies or for your favourites just enter "favs" you get me!!
remove duplicates as standard keep this on!
spam filter as standard keep on too!
also added group exclusions which you can add in your preferences online and add i.e "erotic" and when exclusions 
is enabled it will filter all that crap out
